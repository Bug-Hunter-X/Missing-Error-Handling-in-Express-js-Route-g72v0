This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that's vulnerable to errors if the user ID is not a number or if no user with that ID exists.  The solution, `bugSolution.js`, adds robust error handling to gracefully handle these scenarios and return appropriate HTTP status codes.
